## Main stack
Koin - A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers. Written in pure Kotlin using functional resolution only: no proxy, no code generation, no reflection

Coroutines - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. Coroutines were added to Kotlin in version 1.3 and are based on established concepts from other languages.

Retrofit - Retrofit is a REST Client for Java and Android. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.

MVVM - The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern helps to completely separate the business and presentation logic from the UI, and the business logic and UI can be clearly separated for easier testing and easier maintenance.

Clean Architecture - Clean Architecture combines a group of practices that produce systems with the following characteristics: Testable; UI-independent (the UI can easily be changed without changing the system); Independent of databases, frameworks, external agencies, and libraries
